//TODO: Needs to Hold the rooms starting with the starting room
//TODO: Need to create a map object(dictionary) that holds all the rooms with the key being the name of the room
    // This will be how we will link the room doorways together
    // Will be something like Room: west(name of room) eask(name of room) north(name of room) south(name of room)
    // This will be how we will link the room doorways together from the text save file for the map.

//TODO: could also use JSON Database to store map data.
